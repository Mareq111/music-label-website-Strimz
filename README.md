# Project: Strimz Empire - Music Label

**Deployed Website:** [Strimz Empire - Music Label](https://strimz.netlify.app/)

## 📀🎶 Description

The fictional music label project represents my first major adventure in web development. Initially, it was a modest idea to create a single page showcasing a music album. However, over time, it evolved into a complete vision of a virtual music label inspired by streaming platforms. This process lasted from October to January 2024.

Working on this project was an extremely interesting challenge. During this period, I explored the world of web development, learning on the fly and exploring various aspects of building a website. This project consists of several main sections: "Home", "Releases", "Artists", "Tour", "About", and "Contact Us". However, it does not include a “Shop” section. This decision is intentional, as I plan to create a separate store dedicated to this music label. The store will be available soon!

## 💻🔧 Development Experience

During the development of this project, I focused on learning and experimenting with HTML, SCSS, and JavaScript.

My goal was to design the site so that it would run smoothly on a variety of devices, while providing a pleasant user experience. I wanted the site to be intuitive and leave a positive impression for visitors.

With each new challenge, new possibilities opened up to me, which allowed me to gradually metamorphose an initially simple design into a full vision of a fascinating virtual music label. However, during the creation process, I encountered all sorts of difficulties related, for example, to the responsiveness of the site, UX, and various details that needed to be adjusted and improved. It was a time full of trials and errors, but above all constant learning. Every difficulty encountered was an opportunity to learn new skills and gain a deeper understanding of web development.

Today, looking back, I see this project as a milestone in my journey in front-end development. This experience made me realize how much I still have to discover and how passionate an area web development is.

## ✨🚀 Creative Approach

I enriched the project with a number of sub-pages showcasing albums and singles by various artists, giving users the opportunity to listen to albums or singles. I first started by creating unconventional album covers, using only my own photos, which I then reworked in graphics applications such as PicsArt and Photoshop to give them a unique feel. The results of this work were unusual, underground/abstract music covers.

In addition, I wanted each album/single to have a unique "tracks" that would make it stand out. Then I started experimenting with FL Studio Mobile, taking my first steps in creating abstract, experimental "tracks".

## 💡📈 Reflections

I have some thoughts about my first project. I realized that earlier and more thorough planning could have made the whole process go more smoothly. Perhaps I could have planned the details better, which would have helped avoid problems and speed up the project. In future projects, I plan to make improvements in the styling and standardization of elements, for example, by using components. This will allow me to more systematize the appearance of individual pages, which I hope will help achieve greater visual consistency throughout the site and increase the readability of its elements.
